# connect_4_website
This is a simple Connect 4 game that can be played online. I want to make this game since I was inspired by a project I did while taking a course in AI at SMU. I won the competition with that project, and I want to have other people be able to face my bot online. I also want to make this game so that I can learn more about web development.
